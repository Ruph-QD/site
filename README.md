# What ?
Website for a school project.
Different users can log in. There are 3 roles : runner, coach and admin. Typically, a coach has a group of runners and can add or remove them from his group. A runner can request a test measurement (pulsation and reflex with an Arduino part). The admin manages the website and its users.
